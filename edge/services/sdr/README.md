# SDR service API

Assuming that `ibm.sdr` is the host name:

## `/freqs`
Get a list of the frequencies of strong radio stations.

`curl ibm.sdr:8080/freqs`

Example response:
If the SDR hardware is present it will return a list of string FM stations.
`{"origin":"sdr_hardware","freqs":[89700000,91100000,91900000,93300000,94500000,95700000,96100000,97700000,99100000,101500000,102300000,103700000,105100000,107900000]}`

If the SDR hardware is not present or can not be used for some reason it will return a single station of frequency 0.
`{"origin":"fake","freqs":[0]}`

## /audio/<freq>
Get a 30 second chunk of raw audio.
`curl ibm.sdr:8080/audio/99100000`

`curl ibm.sdr:8080/audio/99100000 | aplay -r 16000 -f S16_LE -t raw -c 1`

If the SDR hardware is not present or can not be used for some reason you can curl the fake station at frequency 0, which will call out to BBC radio online.

`curl ibm.sdr:8080/audio/0 | aplay -r 16000 -f S16_LE -t raw -c 1`

If your device doesn't support the `aplay` command (ie Mac), you can also use the `play` command.

`curl ibm.sdr:8080/audio/0 | play --rate 8000 --bits 16 --encoding signed-integer --channels 2 -t raw -`
